All of my customizations, including the zsh shell, aliases, themes, and plugins.

Set Up
========

1. `git clone http://github.com/sameetandpotatoes/dotfiles ~/dotfiles`
2. `cd ~/dotfiles`
3. `sh install.sh`
4. If you choose to use my theme, please copy `sameet.zsh-theme` to ~./oh-my-zsh/themes with this command:
5. cp `sameet.zsh-them ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/`
6. If using iTerm2, you can click the font to install it in OS X Fontbook, and then enable it within iTerm.
7. Open a new Terminal window to see the effects!
