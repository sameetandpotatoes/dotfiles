Features:
 - Displays current working directory (last two directories)
 - Displays Git branch status
 - Displays status code of previous command and time

 Note: All of the above features (including colors) can be configured within the zsh theme, if you choose to do so.

Set Up
========

1. `git clone http://github.com/sameetandpotatoes/dotfiles`
2. `cd dotfiles`
3. `bash ./install.sh`
4. If using iTerm2 (you kind of have to be for this to work), you can click the font to install it, and then enable it within iTerm2.
5. Close and reopen the terminal to see the effects!
