dotfiles
========

Script that sets up zsh (with [spaceship](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-zsh-theme)) and my iTerm 2 customizations.

Note: All of the above features (including colors) can be configured within the zsh theme, if you choose to do so.

Set Up
========

1. `git clone http://github.com/sameetandpotatoes/dotfiles`
2. `cd dotfiles`
3. `bash ./install.sh`
4. If using iTerm2 (you kind of have to be for this to work), you can click the font to install it, and then enable it within iTerm2.

Support
========

Script supports MacOS and Debian-based systems. Support for more will be added on request.
